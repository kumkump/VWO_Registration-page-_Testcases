Project description:

The goal of this project is to create and execute test cases for the registration page of a website called "VWO". The registration page is a critical component of the website as it allows new users to sign up for the platform and access its features.

The registration page should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it functions as expected and that there are no issues that prevent users from successfully registering for the platform. The test cases should cover various scenarios that users may encounter while using the registration page, including both positive and negative cases.

Some of the key features of the registration page that will be tested include:

Input fields for personal information such as name, email address, and password
Verification of email address and password strength
Error messages displayed when input is invalid
Confirmation page after successful registration
User interface design and layout
The test cases will be designed to cover the functional requirements of the registration page and ensure that it is user-friendly and easy to navigate. The testing process will involve creating test cases, executing them, and documenting the results.

The final output of this project will be a comprehensive test plan that includes test cases and their expected results, as well as a report detailing the testing process and any issues encountered. This will ensure that any issues with the registration page are identified and addressed before the platform is released to users.
